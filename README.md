# FP Zombies

Zombie addon for FPARMA missions

This is not working without not-included dependencies, sorry

### For mission makers
Use the template provided in releases. Edit config.sqf

Check out the mission and look at the comments to see how things work

### Zones

Put down a trigger and enter `true` as the condition (nothing else required)
and put the following into activation field

`[thisTrigger, AMOUNT (0 = fpz_defaultDensity, -1 = infinite. can be higheer)] call fpz_api_fnc_registerZone;`

Zombies will spawn within the trigger area once players are near, maximum the amount provided
Once a zombie is killed, the amount gets decremented and can not respawn (don't delete them with zeus)

There's more parameters, if needed

`[thisTrigger, AMOUNT, ACTIVATE DISTANCE, RADIUS, MAX ACTIVE IN ZONE] call fpz_api_fnc_registerZone;`

ACTIVATE DISTANCE = when the object should activate and start trying to spawn

RADIUS = how large of an area. useful when using other objects than a trigger

Is default the max of X/Y size

### How to spawn hordes
Same thing, put down a trigger but this time you can choose the activation type, either when some variable is set or some more complex condition.

In the activation you enter

`[thisTrigger, <AMOUNT>] call fpz_api_fnc_spawnHorde;`

Horde will spawn randomly throughout the trigger. The first parameter is where to spawn, it can be another trigger or a position. E.g
`[someOtherTrigger, <AMOUNT>] call fpz_api_fnc_spawnHorde;`

Additionally, there's two more parameters:

`[thisTrigger, <AMOUNT>, <PLAY SOUND>, <IGNORE MAX ZOMBIES>] call fpz_api_fnc_spawnHorde;`

### Using in other mission
If you're not using the template, fpz can be initialized using debug console local exec:

`[] remoteExecCall ["fpz_api_fnc_init", 0, "fpz_init"];`
